**`BSc in Media Industries and Technologies from Northwestern University`**

I'm an undergraduate student who has just recently became motivated to delve into coding. I'm especially interested in quantum computing, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and computer forensics.

### üíª Computer Science related learning

I have completed Amazon's Future Engineer's Building Solutions in the Cloud virtual work experience, and I am currently taking Harvard University's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course, and the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate courses on Coursera. I am also a member of Northwestern University's Data Science club where we reorganise Kaggle data on VS Code with Python. Currently, I am on Week 1 of CS50 so I am learning C, but ideally I would like to learn Python, Java, SQL, R, Kotlin, Swift. and Powershell.

### ‚òï Projects

**`or more like project PLANS because I'm still not the most comfortable with coding`**

- Book review app: will require Swift for IOS, Kotlin for Android
- Astrophysics and environmental science data portfolio: will require Python, SQL, and R
- Cybersecurity projects such as packet sniffer, keylogger: will require Python, Powershell, Linux
